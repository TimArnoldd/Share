        <li>Write a message and press send. You've just your first message!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now to use the same chat on your other devices, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open <a href="https://share.vodka">share.vodka</a> on a different device.</li>
        <li>On that device, click on "Set Token" in the Menu.</li>
        <li>Type in the Room-ID that you can see in the chat and press "Set Token". You will be redirected to the chat again.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The chat is now visible from the other device! Now you can send messages from each device and have a history of them. In the future you'll be able to share:</p>
    <ul>
