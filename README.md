A system to easily share things



## Applications

- [Backend](./backend) ([README.md](./backend/README.md))
- [Web-Frontend](./web-frontend) ([README.md](./web-frontend/README.md))



## Docker Startup

You can use Docker Compose to easily start the entire application or host it on any machine, that supports Docker Compose:

- Building the app: `docker compose build`
- Starting the containers: `docker compose up -d`
  - `-d` for detached
- Stopping (and deleting) the containers: `docker compose down`
